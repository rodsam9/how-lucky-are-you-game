# How Lucky Are You? (MiniGame)
    This game is of pure luck! How lucky are you feeling right now?
## How to Play
    The game is simple to play.
    There is a 3x3 board game with 9 crates/boxes in total. Under each box, there is either a dollar-sign, or an explosion.
    You start off the game with 100 points as your score.
    You must guess and click on the boxes you think contain the dollar-sign.
    For every dollar-sign you get, that'll be 10 points added to your temporary score. In order to have those points be added to your actual score, you must click submit, and whatever temporary points you accumulated, will be added to your score.
    Now note that if you keep guessing correctly and keep getting dollar-signs, but then accidentally get an explosion without submitting first, then you will lose 10 points and all those temporary points will dissapear as well.
    Every explosion loses you 10 points, and every dollar-sign gives you 10 points.

    See how lucky you are, and see how many points you can gain!
    Best of luck!
